## BOTO3
 
In this repository I show some code templates that I use to work on AWS with BOTO3.

Boto3 is the name of the Python SDK for AWS. It allows you to directly create, update, and delete AWS resources from your Python scripts.

I am working to put more things in this repository not related directly to Boto3, like some templates for AWS Lambda.
