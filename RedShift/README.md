                <p>Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, columnar cloud data warehouse. You can use it to run complex analytical queries on large datasets through massively parallel processing (MPP) technology. Datasets can range from gigabytes to petabytes.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Amazon Redshift ML uses Amazon SageMaker to train the models. After you exhaust the AWS Free Tier for SageMaker, you will incur costs for creating your model and a small storage charge for Amazon S3. Amazon Redshift ML uses your existing cluster resources for prediction, and no additional charges are incurred for making predictions.</p>
