EC2
  ELASTIC compute power 
      grow or shrink or the load in your application
  virtual servers in the cloud
  
  REVIEW:
    - Region
        conten multiple AZs.
      - AZ (availabity zone)
          A single AZ contains multiple data centers
        - Data Center:
            A single data center contains multiple server.
          - Server  
            the servers are the physical compute hardware running in a data center
            - EC2
               EC2 instances are the virtual servers running on these physical servers.
               obs: instances are note considered serverLESS.
    
  
  FOUNDATIONS
    - you can use a preconfigured template called an ***Amazon Machine Image*** (AMI) to launch your instance.
    - you can deploy your applications directly to ec2
    - you can receive 750 compute hours per month on the Free Tier plan.

   EC2 in the real World:
      - deploy a database in a EC2 to have full control of it.
      - deploy a web application; if you deploy into multiple regions, the web application will be highly available.  
  
  METHODS TO ACESS
    - AWS management console
    - SSH
      how:
        GENERATE A KEY PAIR, it consiste of a private key and public key.
          - private key - used on your pc
          - public key - used on ec2
          - your public key is like your bank account number and your private key is like your password in your bank account.
    - EIC (EC2 instance connect) 
    - EIC allows you to use IAM policies to control SSH access to your instances, removing  the need to manage SSH.
    - AWS System Manager - Allows you to manage your EC2 instances via a web broser or the AWS CLI.

======================================================================

EC2 price options:
  
  ON-DEMAND use cases:
    - fixed price and no contract
    - you care about low cost without any upfront payment or long-term commiment
    - your application have unpredictable workloads that can't be interrupted
    - your application are under development
    - your application will not run longer than a year

    *  Fun facts:
        you can reserve capacity using On-Demand Capacity Reservations, even if you are running or not your instances.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  SPOT 
    - Spot instances let you take ***advantagge of unused EC2 capacity***. Your request is fulfilled only if capacity is available.
    - You are not concerned about the start or stop time of your application
    - your workloads can be interruptedo 
    - your application is only feasible(viavel) at a very low compute prices.
    * fun facts:
      - you can save up 90% of On-Demand prices.
      - you pay the spot price that's in effect at the begininning of each hour.

  Reserved Instances(RIs)
    - allows you to commit to a specific instance type in a particular Region for  1 or 3 years.

    * Use Reserved Instances when:
     - your application has steady(estavel) state usage, and you can commit to 1 or 3 years.
     - you can pay upfront in order to receive a discount on On-Demand prices.
     - your application requires a capacity reservation
    
    * fun facts:
      - U can save 75% off On-Demand prices
      - U are required to sign a contract
      - You can reserve a capacity in an Availability Zone for any duration.

    You can reserve capacity in an Availability Zone for any duration
      - you can pay All Upfront, Partial Upfron, No Upfront. All Upfront for the max term earns the highest discount.
      - Provides convertible types ( change the: instance family, operate system, tenacy model) at 54% discount.
      
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  DEDICATED HOST 
    - Allow you to par for a physical server that is fully dedicated to running your instancs.
    - Use dedicated hosts when: 
      - you want to bring  your own server-bound software license from vendors like Microsoft.    
      - you have regulatory or corporate compliance requirements around tenancy(locação) model.
     
      - fun facts:
        - U can save up to 70% of On-Demand prices.
        - U bring your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses.  
        - There is no multi tenancy(locação), meaning the server is not shared w/ other customers.
        - A Dedicated Host is a physical server, whereas a Dedicated Instance runs on the host.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  SAVINGS PLAN
  
    * Use Savings Plans when:
      - U want to lower your bill across multiple compute services.
      - U want flexibility to change compute services, instance types, operating systems, or Regions.
    
    * Fun facts:
      - U can sv up to 72% of On-Demand prices.
      - U are not making a commitment to a Dedicated Host, just compute usage.
      - Saving can be shared across various compute services like EC2, Fargate, and Lambda.
      - This does not provide a capacity reservation.

FEATURES 
    
  - EC2 instances offer load balancing and Auto Scaling
    1 - Elastic Load Balancing: 
        - Automaticlly distributes you incoming application traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
        * types: 
           - CLASSIC LOAD BALANCERS 
           - APPLICATION LOAD BALANCERS 
           - GATEWAY LOAD BALANCERS 
           - NETWORK LOAD BALANCERS

    2 - EC2 Auto Scaling:
        - Adds or replaces EC2 instances automatically across AZs, based on need and changing demand.
        - HORIZONTAL SCALING OR SCALING OUT
          - Auto Scaling reduces the impact of system failures and improves the availability of your application; Obs: Do not confuse horizontal scaling vertical (or scaling up), which upgrade an EC2 instance by adding more power(CPU. RAM) to an existing server.
