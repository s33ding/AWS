  What is the current load on this EC2 instances?
  What is the root cause of this applications error?
  Which execution path resulted in this error?

CloudWatch 
  It is a collection of services that help you monitor and observe your cloud resources
  Collects metrics, logs, and events
  Detect anomalies in your environment
  Set alarms
  Vizualize logs

    CloudWatch Alarms - set high resolution alarms
    CloudWatch Logs - monitor applications logs
    CloudWatch Metrics - vizualize time-series data
    CloudWatch Events - trigger an event based on a condition

    Provide real-time monitoring on EC2:  
      CloudWatch Alarms can notify you if an EC2 instance goes into the stopped state or usage goes above a certain utilization.
        ec2 instance w/ 50% utilization > Cloud Watch Alarms > SNS > Email

    Receive a notification when root user activity is detected in your account:
      Root User Login Event > CloudWatch Events > SNS >  emails

CloudTrail

      You can troubleshoot events over the past 90 days using the CloudTrail event history log to find the specific time an event occurred on a per-Region basis. You can create custom trail to extend past 90 days.

  Things you can track w/ CloudTrail:
    Usernames
    Event time and name
