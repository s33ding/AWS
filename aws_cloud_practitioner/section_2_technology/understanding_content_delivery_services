Content Delivery Network (CDN)
   
  It is a machnism to deliver conten quickly and effciently based on geographic location.

Amazon CloudFront 
  
  It is a CDN that delivers data and  applications globally w/ low latency. 
  ex:
    Even if your app is in a single region you can still deliver it globally, bc of CloudFront. 

  It can deliver the content globally  or restict based on the location.
  
  It speeds up delivery of static and dynamic web content.

  It can be used for:
    Precent attacks like DDoS
    IP address blocking

  The origin of the data in the Distribution Cache can be from:
    S3
    EC2 
    Elastic Load Balancer
  
  Definitions:

    static website:
       It runs on the cliente browser, there is no need to go back to the service to deliver the content. The CloudFront speeds up the service by using edge locations to cache content.
    static website:

    Edge Locations:
       Mini data center where files are cached.

    Distrib. Cache:
      Name given to the collection of edge locations.
    
    Obs:
       W/ edge location you are not provisioning ec2 instance, this is for static content.
