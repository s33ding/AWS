Software developers use tools to accelerate the software development and  release cycle.

Cloud9 
  Allows you to write code within an integrated development environment (IDE) from within your web browser.  
  features:
    IDE
    Write and debug right in your web browser
    Supports popular programming languages 
    ex:
      build serverless applications 
       Preconfigures the development environment w/ the needed SDKs and libraries. You can easily write the code for your Lambda function directly in your web browser. 
      
CodeCommit 
  It is a source control system for private Git repositories
  Create repositories to store code 
  Commit, branch and merge code
  Collaborate w/ other software developers
  
  ex: 
    Manage versions of source code files for your application.

CodeBuild
  Allows you to build and test your application source code 
  Compiles source code and runs tests 
  Enables continuos integrations and delivery 
  Produces build artifacts ready to be deployed

  ex:
    Run tests before deploying a new version of an application to production - Allows you to run as many parallel streams of tests as needed, allowing you to deploy your changes to production more quickly.

CodeDeploy
  Manages the deployment of code to compute services in the cloud or on-premises.
  Deploys code to EC2, Fargate, Lambda, and on-premises.
  Maintains applications uptime.
  
  ex:
    CodeDeploy eliminates the downtime of your application when deploying a new version due to its rolling deployments.

CodePipeline 
  automates the software release process.
  Quickly dliver new feartures and updates.
  Integrates w/ CodeBuild ro run builds and unit tests 
  Integrates w/ CodeCommit to retrieve source code.
  Integrates w/ CodeDeploy to deploy your changes.  

  ex:
    When combined w/ other developer tools, CodePipeline helps develoopment teams implement DevOps practices that automate testing and the movement of code to production.
    
X-Ray
  Helps you debug production applications.
  Analyze and debug aproduction applications 
  Map application components
  View requests end to end

  ex:
    Can help you map requests made to your RDS database from within your application. You can tracj informaion about the SQL queries generated and more.
    

CodeStar
  CodeStar helps developers collaboratively work on development projects
  Developers connect their development environment 
  Integrates w/ CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.
  Contain issues track dashboards
  ex:
    CodeStar can manage the development pipeline.
